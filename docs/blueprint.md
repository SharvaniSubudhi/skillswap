## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep slate blue (#3B5273). Inspired by academia, it brings sophistication and trust. Its moderate saturation avoids unnecessary brightness, as the application aims to serve as a tool rather than entertainment.
- Background color: Pale gray (#E8E8EA). Desaturated hue to give the app a light backdrop.
- Accent color: Royal purple (#7851A9).  Offers a contrasting tone to the primary color while maintaining harmony. The result conveys refinement and creative potential.
- Headline Font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif. Body Font: 'Inter' sans-serif. 'Space Grotesk' is well-suited for headlines, and the combination with 'Inter' will allow for clean body text.
- Use clean, line-based icons that are related to skills. Use consistent styling with rounded corners to complement the modern sans-serif typography.
- Employ a clean and structured layout with a focus on usability. Utilize a grid system to maintain consistency across different sections. Ensure sufficient white space to avoid clutter and improve readability.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback to user interactions. Avoid excessive or distracting animations. Example: Fading effects when loading content or smooth scrolling transitions.
